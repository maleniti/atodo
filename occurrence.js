// Pure helpers over the { tasks, occurrences } data model -- no DOM, no
// network, same UMD-lite pattern as recurrence.js (module.exports under
// Node so occurrence.test.js can require it directly, window.Occurrence in
// the browser).
//
// A Task is a recurrence PATTERN (dueDate/frequency/endDate/...). An
// Occurrence is one interacted-with instance of it, sparse: a
// pattern-predicted date with nothing recorded against it yet (still
// pending, no note, no override, no timer) has no row at all -- exactly
// like an absent key in the old completions/dismissed/markedFailed maps
// meant "still pending". Occurrences are addressed by (taskId,
// occurrenceDate) -- taskId, not any single Task record's own id, since a
// "this and following" split forks a new Task row for the pattern going
// forward while every already-recorded Occurrence stays exactly where it is.
//
// recurUntilCompleted tasks keep at most one 'pending' Occurrence alive at a
// time -- see recurrenceShim below for how its pendingReschedules chain
// feeds back into recurrence.js's own chain-membership logic unchanged.
// pendingReschedules is reused for a second, unrelated purpose on a plain
// task's occurrence too: the history of dates it's been manually
// rescheduled AWAY from (see isDateExcluded) -- same "every date this
// occurrence has touched" shape, opposite direction (still-live chain vs.
// dead exclusions), never both meaningful on the same occurrence at once.
